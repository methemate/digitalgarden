> Understand that this subject should be approached with **Wisdom from the Lord**. My view on this changed within the past year because of this study. I would **refrain from reading** and **only come back when the Lord prompt you** to explore this further.
## **Three Places Mentioned**

3 places that mentioned

[[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/46 - 1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 14/1 Corinthians 14\|1 Corinthians 14]] (wrote for Corinthians)  
[[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/54 - 1 Timothy/1 Timothy 2/1 Timothy 2\|1 Timothy 2]] (for Ephesus)  
[[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/56 - Titus/Titus 1/Titus 1\|Titus 1]] (for Crete)

Usually when there is correction in a letter, the writer is using wisdom and spiritual guidance to correct current events. You should try to understand the ways of God first.

## **So what event was he correcting?**

## **Corinth**
This was about **==disorder==**.

In Corinth, people were worshipping **Aphrodite**. Aphrodite’s cult was tied to *sexual freedom* and *indulgence*. The environment encouraged women to use sexuality as power, **leading to abuse of roles**. “your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit” reaffirm that sexuality as under Christ’s authority, not a goddess’s. (To worship the goddess, you would go to her temple and have sex with the priests). So you can see how Aphrodite had so much influence.

At that time, women were also **disruptive during worship** (some people say for lack of education; Imo their questions were more so because they are taught by the Aphrodite worshipper). So Paul decree for them to ask their husband.

## **Ephesus**
This was about domination theology.

In Ephesus (Timothy), the Goddess at hand was Artemis (or Diana). She’s a Goddess with many bosoms. Artemis was associated with fertility, protection in childbirth, and female power.

In Acts 19:23–41, silversmiths rioted over Paul’s preaching because it threatened Artemis worship in Ephesus.

</div></div>




## **Crete**
This was about restoring order.

In Crete, for Titus, He was sent to appoint elders / overseers. Crete was steeped in Greek mythology, especially the worship of Zeus, who was born there. (Zeus is Baal rebranded for the Greek).

Paul quoted their prophet saying “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">

*While I’m not entirely sure about the connection*, Rhea was worshipped as Zeus mother. There were female led worship and probably other doctrine that leads to much disorder.

That’s likely why Paul in [[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/56 - Titus/Titus 2/Titus 2\|Titus 2]] instructed **the older women to teach younger women** “to love their husbands, to love their children, to be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored.”

## **Pastors (I prefer Shepherds)**

No one was named as Shepherds in the scripture. There are people with that function though.

## **Functions vs Offices**

The function is there.  
But the office is not always named.

Elders are required to teach.  
Teaching is pervasive but rarely titled.

**Women clearly perform the functions.**

## **So can Women be elders?**

Idk.

They seems to perform the functions.  
But Paul did not mentioned them in Titus.

## **Can they be deacons?**

Yes, clearly mentioned in 1 Timothy.

## **What's the Wisdom?**

Women in both Old and New Testaments clearly exercised **spiritual authority, teaching, and prophetic roles**.  
Paul’s restrictions addressed **local cultural distortions**, not **universal exclusion** from leadership or spiritual offices.
When men failed to come into the calling God has for them, Women are then called forth. But God is not one to revoke a gift or a calling (Romans). Thus, **the gifts and calling remain on them as they stepped up into that calling.**
