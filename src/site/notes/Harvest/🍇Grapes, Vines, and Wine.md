#### ⚠️ Causes [[Concept/Folly\|Folly]] and Testing

> **Genesis 9:20–21** – Noah planted a vineyard and drank of the wine
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



### 20
And Noah [[H5146\|H5146]] began [[H2490\|H2490]] an husbandman, [[H582\|H582]] and he planted [[H5193\|H5193]] a vineyard: [[H3754\|H3754]]

### 🕯️ **Summary Insight**

> The vine tells the story of **relationship and result**.  
> When rooted in God, it yields _joy, blessing, and covenant fruit_.  
> When cut off, it becomes the _vine of the earth_, crushed in wrath.
> 
> The same clusters that brought joy to Noah, sorrow to Isaiah, and wrath in Revelation become, in Christ, **the Cup of Salvation** — the **wine of the New Covenant** poured out for many.
