Our God is the **Father of Lights** ([[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/59 - James/James 1/James 1#17\|James 1#17]]).  
Jesus is **the Light** ([[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/43 - John/John 8/John 8#12\|John 8#12]]).  
Jesus called us **the light of the world** ([[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/40 - Matthew/Matthew 5/Matthew 5#14\|Matthew 5#14]]).
### What Does Light Do?

Light **shines into darkness**, and darkness cannot remain.  
In John, it is written that **the light came into the world**, and **the darkness did not overcome it nor comprehend it** ([[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/43 - John/John 1/John 1#5\|John 1#5]]).  
(The Greek carries both meanings: _to overpower_ and _to grasp or understand_.)
### Light From the Beginning to the Kingdom

At the beginning of creation, God said, **“Let there be light”** ([[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/01 - Genesis/Genesis 1/Genesis 1#3\|Genesis 1#3]]).  
At the end, when the Kingdom of God is fully revealed, **the glory of God is the light;  the Lamb it's the Lamp; and glory that the kings (us) brought are also a source of light ** ([[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/66 - Revelation/Revelation 21/Revelation 21#23\|Revelation 21#23]]).

Jesus said that **the Son does nothing except what He sees the Father doing** ([[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/43 - John/John 5/John 5#19\|John 5#19]]).  
What the Father revealed in creation, the Son brought into the world -**light in the midst of darkness**. And in the End, God's word is fulfilled on Earth as well- our forever home with Him.
### The Defeat of Darkness

Had the rulers of this age understood God’s plan, **they would not have crucified the Lord of glory** ([[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/46 - 1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians 2/1 Corinthians 2#8\|1 Corinthians 2#8]]).  
Yet through His death and resurrection, we are made **sons in the Kingdom of God** ([[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/45 - Romans/Romans 8/Romans 8#14\|Romans 8#14]]).

As sons of God, we are called to **do likewise**:
- ==To **be the light** that shines in dark places==
- ==To **push back darkness** where it seeks to remain==
### Our Role
It is **not** God’s design that we sit idle while He alone pushes back darkness.  
It is His will that **we participate**, walking as children of light
>**Ephesians 5:8**

This authority is exercised through **obedience and overcoming temptation** ([[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/66 - Revelation/Revelation 12/Revelation 12#11\|Revelation 12#11]]).
