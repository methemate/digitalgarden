## **What's Prepare the Way?**
In days past, a King in victory would announce himself coming prior to going past an area. What people would do is to **lower the mountains** *(places of idols altars)* and **fill up the valley** *(places of idols sacrifice)* to make the road flat. Then they would redo the terrain and make the way straight so that **the King** and **His train** (officials, soldiers, captives, spoils) can go through. It's a victory laps.

- Why in the wilderness and not in the city? Because sin has created stronghold that makes it
- God's tabernacle used to dwell with Israel in the beginning and was later moved outside of the camp of Israel after much sin entered their camp.
- When the Israelites complained, God sent snakes and causes many to perish. They cried out to Moses who cried out to God. God told Moses to life a snake outside of the Camp. Those who went out and see the snake (in their pain and suffering) were healed. (also mentioned in [[KJV Tagged + Lexicon/Bible 2/43 - John/John 3/John 3#14\|John 3#14]] likened to how we are saved by putting our faith in Chris)
- Christ did healed a blind man but he pulled him outside of the camp (add address here)
- The [[Repentance\|Repentance]] that John preach requires proof before baptism is applied. (1) They left their camp to go to the wilderness and (2) They have to bring a proof of repentance. Much of the church today lack the proof of repentance. Repentance means to **turn away from sin** as much as **turning to God**.

And [[G1161\|G1161]] John [[G2491\|G2491]] was [[G2258\|G2258]] clothed with [[G1746\|G1746]] camel's [[G2574\|G2574]] hair, [[G2359\|G2359]] and [[G2532\|G2532]] with a girdle [[G2223\|G2223]] of a skin [[G1193\|G1193]] about [[G4012\|G4012]] his [[G846\|G846]] loins; [[G3751\|G3751]] and [[G2532\|G2532]] he did eat [[G2068\|G2068]] locusts [[G200\|G200]] and [[G2532\|G2532]] wild [[G66\|G66]] honey; [[G3192\|G3192]]


</div></div>

- Camel's hair, a girdle of skin were the attire of the prophet Elijah whom Jesus likened John too. 
- Camel's hair are rarely used at the time; it's are much more **uncomfortable** than linen at the time. so is the girdle. Most of use would not eat [[The Locust\|The Locust]] or the wild honey --> Part of the outward working of [[Repentance\|Repentance]] is to afflict oneself (taking away your own comfort)
- However, Camel's hair keeps you warmer in the cold whether of the wilderness and cooler in the heat of the day. --> It's **peculiar** that the thing that many overlooked, even steer clear from, are **beneficial** in the eyes of God. 
- Had John not inflicted himself by wearing camel's hair he might not have survived the wilderness.
- Locusts are food that are Clean to eat according to the Law of Moses. They represent the overlooked things.
- Wild Honey are **sweet** the taste yet **bitter** in the stomach. This represent [[the Word of God\|the Word of God]].
- What does John represent then? Those who are called to prepare the way? Is that not us?

- Think about Abraham men (find the reference). Abraham brought 300 men against 10,000. He fought against multiple kingdom. Mind you these kingdom fought the Giants to get into the land (Find the reference). Yes, the Lord were with them. But would untrained men have the **==courage==** to carry the call?

- **YET**, being trained doesn't mean everything. When Gideon called upon Ephraim to fight the Midian and ... (Find the reference), although they were trained with the bow refused the called. ==***Thus, they did not join in the glory of the battle.***== 
- Notice he said "Let the Lord do that which seemed good to Him" after preparing for war and just before he's about to fight the enemy. We the church often think that we just need to wait and let the Lord take everything back for us. **==Yet, THAT'S NOT GOD"S WAY. WAKE UP==**

There are times when trouble come **by no cause**, even from those who you called friend. **By lack of discernment**, the nations are deceived. **Nations shall called upon nations** to stand up against The Lord and His Kingdom (and us). *What shall we do?* **Like David sent Joab. He has sent us forth**. *Are we trained? Can we fight Giants and Mighty men?* ==**Be of Good Courage!**==
